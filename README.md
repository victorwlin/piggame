This is a dice game for two players playing hotseat. With each roll you make, more gets added to your current score, but if you roll the same number twice in a row, you will lose everything. When you are satisfied with your current score, you can hold your score to have it added to your total score but doing so will end your turn. The first player who reaches 100 total score wins.

This game was made using vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It was created primarily to practice DOM manipulation.
